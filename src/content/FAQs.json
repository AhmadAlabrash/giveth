		"answer": "Fiat integration (donate funds from your credit card or bank account) is coming soon! Stay tuned...\r\n\r\nGiveth has also partnered with SDG Impact Fund to make it possible for donors to contribute tax-deductible donations, in fiat or crypto, to altruistic projects on the blockchain. This is a major development in finance innovation to effectively care for the commons. We are very close to having fiat options integrated with the Dapp. Until then, fiat donations will accepted here: (<a href='https://www.sdgimpactfund.org/giveth-foundation' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://www.sdgimpactfund.org/giveth-foundation</a>).

		"question": "Does the IRS recognize cryptocurrency donations?",
		"answer": "The IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as property, so cryptocurrency donations to 501c3 organizations receive the same tax treatment as stocks.\r"
	},
	{
		"question": "Why donate cryptocurrency?",
		"answer": "Cryptocurrency knows no borders and marginalizes no one. It can not be taken from you if you alone hold your keys. \n Another advantage: When you donate with crypto, you do not realize capital gains from the crypto you hold, and you can deduct it from your taxes. In other words, donating your crypto can often reduce your tax burden. Would you rather donate to the IRS or your favorite cause?"

		"question": "What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?",
		"answer": "Bitcoin is intended to function as decentralized means of value transfer whereas Ethereum is a protocol that allows users to develop decentralized applications on top of a blockchain network. As prominent Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir has confirmed on several occasions, Ethereum is “not money.” Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH) exists in order to facilitate the process of building and deploying distributed applications. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin currency exists on the Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of uncensorable, non-confiscatable money.<br/><br/> <a href='https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-s-the-difference-between-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>From cryptocompare.com</a>."

	{
		"question": "What is Blockchain?",
		"answer": "In simple terms, a blockchain is a method of storing and transferring information. It can be considered a kind of database that is not stored in a single computer. Instead, many identical copies are distributed in several computers called nodes. Information on a blockchain is stored in a continuous chain of blocks with each block containing essential information (for example, transactions) and the cryptographic hash of the previous block. To change the information in any block, you have to make changes to all subsequent blocks. The content of the blocks is verified by the consensus of all nodes in the network. These two features makes it very difficult to alter any information already included in the blocks, and this difficulty increases with the number of nodes in the network."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is Ethereum?",
		"answer": "It's the world's programmable blockchain.<br/><br/>Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation with some big differences.\r\nBoth let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for many different digital assets – even Bitcoin!\r\nThis also means Ethereum is for more than just payments. It's a network of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.\r\nSo step into the bazaar, and give it a try..."

	{
		"question": "What is Giveth?",
