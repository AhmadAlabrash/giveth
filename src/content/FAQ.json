      "question": "Does the IRS recognize cryptocurrency donations?",
      "answer": "The IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as property, so cryptocurrency donations to 501c3 organizations receive the same tax treatment as stocks.\r"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why donate cryptocurrency?",
      "answer": "Cryptocurrency knows no borders and marginalizes no one. It can not be taken from you if you alone hold your keys. \n Another advantage: When you donate with crypto, you do not realize capital gains from the crypto you hold, and you can deduct it from your taxes. In other words, donating your crypto can often reduce your tax burden. Would you rather donate to the tax agency or your favorite cause?"

      "question": "What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?",
      "answer": "Bitcoin is intended to function as decentralized means of value transfer whereas Ethereum is a protocol that allows users to develop decentralized applications on top of a blockchain network. As prominent Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir has confirmed on several occasions, Ethereum is “not money.” Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH) exists in order to facilitate the process of building and deploying distributed applications. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin currency exists on the Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of uncensorable, non-confiscatable money.<br/><br/> From <a href='https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-s-the-difference-between-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>cryptocompare.com</a>."

    {
      "question": "What is Blockchain?",
      "answer": "A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party."

    {
      "question": "What is Ethereum?",
      "answer": "\"It's the world's programmable blockchain. Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences. Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets – even Bitcoin! This also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.\" </br></br> From <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Ethereum.org</a> website"

    {
      "question": "What is a Traceable project?",
      "answer": "A project on Giveth.io that has been verified can choose to become a Campaign on Giveth TRACE, thus becoming a traceable project. This enables project creators to manage their donations transparently using Traces. Traces specify how the project is using their donations to achieve the goals of the overarching Campaigns. Upgrading giveth.io projects to Campaigns enables project creators to specify parts of their project requiring funding as different types of Traces. Donors benefit from being able to choose to fund either specific Traces or the overarching Campaign, and are able to trace the flow of their donations. A traceable project appears on both Giveth TRACE (as a Campaign) and Giveth.io, allowing for double exposure! To learn how to make your project traceable, visit our documentation."
